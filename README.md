# Facial-Engagement-Detection
In this project, we have worked
on Facial Engagement Detection in Real-time Webcam Videos, where we explore various facial
recognition and engagement detection algorithms using deep learning architectures. We also
implemented a custom facial engagement analysis on webcam videos with a teacher and student
using autoencoders in OpenCV. This work has taken inspiration from various topics such as face
detection, emotion analysis, and attention networks. This was achieved with the help of ML
libraries such as PyTorch, DeepFace, OpenCV, Sklearn, and Tensorflow.
